# Data-Pipelines

## “So many books, so little time…”

![alt libros](Input/books-portada2.jpg)

### Overview

The goal of this project is to build a data pipeline that processes the data and produces a result. In this case the result will be a book recommendation based on the genre and year selected by the user.

In order to build the API, first we have to clean and manipulate the books dataset (check Pre-data-analysis jupyter notebook) so that we can get all the information needed via the API.


### Program Workflow

The program will receive two parameters; age and genre and will run the folowwin actions:

* Filter the [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/sp1thas/book-depository-dataset) from Kaggle containing +55.000 books and return the top book based on ratings.
* Connect with Google Books API to get a description and number of pages of the selected book.
* Generate a PDF including the title, author, description and number of pages of the book.

### Example of Program Execution

To run the program, it is necessary to call it from the terminal in the following way: python3 main.py and add the flags with the arguments to search for: “year” (being the year) and “genre” (being the genre).

Execution example:

> python3 main.py  2010  novel
